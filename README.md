Problem:
I am developing a web application that allows users to generate tables based on data inputted in a form. The user can then export the table as a CSV file. However, I want to ensure that the user inputs data before generating the table, and that the table is generated before allowing the user to export it.

Solve:
I am using SweetAlert.js to display the appropriate alert messages
